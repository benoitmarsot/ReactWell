Reactwell also keeps track of assessment changes over time and allows for providers and patients to easily progress over time.
            </p><p>
                Reactwell was built with the altruistic goal of helping an underserved industry group.

It was built to showcase his ability to create a full-stack application with current technologies.
            </p><p>
                The front-end of the application is built using React which allows for the creation of highly interactive and responsive user interfaces. The back-end of the application is built using PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable open-source database management system. The application is built using the Spring Boot framework which allows for rapid development and easy deployment. Spring Security is used to add security features to the application such as user authentication and authorization. The demo application showcases the combined capabilities of these technologies showcasing their strengths in terms of security, scalability, and user experience.
